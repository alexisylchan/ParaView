# this is a config file for the ceiling/hiball VRPN server
# 
# format for hiball/ceiling is :
#
# vrpn_Tracker_Hiball tracker_name config_file report_Hz
#	 predict_time average_time allows_threads(unused) median_width exponential_factor
#
# tracker_name is the VRPN name for the tracker.  Like Tracker0@tori
#
# config_file is the hiball software configuration file.  Set things like how
# many hiballs are being used (on with tethers) and which ceiling to use.
#
# report_Hz is a target (floating point) for the rate the ceiling
# should send out VRPN reports. 
#
# predict_time is time in milliseconds for KF to predict forward,
# set to 0 for no prediction
#
# average_time is time in milliseconds overwhich to do a simple
# averaging post-filter to quiet noise.
#
# allow_threads should be 0 for 3rdTech install
# (parameter provided for legacy support for two-processor host configuration)
#
# median_width is filter width for median post-filter
#
# exponential_factor is filtering factor for exponentially weighted averaging
#
# Note, only one of these filters may be enabled at a given time.

# 160 Hz update rate, exponential averaging filter with factor 0.1
