# Ceiling information
# Ceilingmap describes the strip connections and physical positions of the
# LEDs.  These values get adjusted by the autocalibration.


# Note: you should change the height in the ceiling map file and
# under 'stripheight' below to correspond to your actual ceiling
# height (default is 10 ft).
