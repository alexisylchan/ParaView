BUGS
=================================================================
Unfixed:
========  
1: Toggle Switch View has same icon as Push To Shared State
4: Temporarily comment out Phantom-scaling by frustum. Heap-reallocation problem.

7: Currently concurrentsync operations are conditionalized by sensorIndex. Need to make conditions sensorIndex agnostic in pqPropertyLinks.cxx and pqVRPNStarter.cxx
9: Source Selection (onSourceChange) in pqVRPNStarter results in rewriting the directory read/write properties because all subsequent files cannot be read.
10: Repeat source selections for filters with multiple inputs
11: In text files, separate representation properties from other properties because they will be set using a separate mechanism (not vtkSMPropertyHelper)
Error messages:

Generic Warning: In ..\..\..\ParaView\Servers\ServerManager\vtkSMPropertyHelper.cxx, line 82
Failed to locate property: Visibility


Generic Warning: In ..\..\..\ParaView\Servers\ServerManager\vtkSMPropertyHelper.cxx, line 184
Call not supported for the current property type.


Fixed:
========  
2: line 306: Source creation: VTK Class Name is different from Source Name, even after stripping of "vtk" and "vtkPV"  ------------------->> Hack:Fixed by making vtkSMProperty::GetXMLName public. 
3: Delete xml snippets when plugin is shutting down. Hack: Fixed by deleting all files in the directory via the batch script used for starting a new instance of the Collaborative Scientific Visualization Workbench.
8: Repeat Filter creation from User0

No Longer an Issue:
========  
5: For Properties Tab properties - pqPropertyLinks::printSMProperties should not be called until "Apply" is clicked. (The behavior is correct for Display Tab Properties because the property changes are applied immediately).


=================================================================
TODO:
=================================================================
1: Combine FilterCreation and Source Creation functions in vtkVRPNPhantomStyleCamera and pqVRPNStarter
2: Factorize pqVRPNStarter::incrementDirectoryFile()   and pqPropertyLinks::incrementDirectoryFile() into a single function
